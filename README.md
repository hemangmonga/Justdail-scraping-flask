# Justdail-scraping-flask

This is a python web scrapping project done using python as a backend and html as frontend. for the project I have used beautifulsoup for scrapping data from the web and used flask to connect the python code to Html and run it on a local server.
<br>
The Flask code is written in app.py and util.py contains the code for scrapping from the web.
Now the html code is saved in templates folder and it needs to be done in the same way for flask to render the html code.

<br>This is how the frontend looks:<br>
